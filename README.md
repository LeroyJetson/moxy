HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a lifestyle blog

If you look four main lines down from the top of the page, or just above the green box with two arrows,
you will see "6 commits". Click on that, and you will be taken to a page where you can review 
the steps I have taken. 

I began with the code provided by Untitled Themes' Discoid, which can be seen at http://discoidtheme.tumblr.com/

After seeing user interface issues, I edited how the hover selection process works. Then I added social media buttons
(the code to which either needs to be updated or has recent incompatability issues with tumblr). I imported, then
ediited some jQuery into the site in order to clean it up aesthetically. The final product is Field Trip Moxy,
a blog designed to showcase the youth culture of Downtown Milwaukee, and can be seen here http://fieldtripmoxy.tumblr.com/
