HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a lifestyle blog

I began with the code provided by Untitled Themes' Discoid, which can be seen at http://discoidtheme.tumblr.com/

After seeing user interface issues, I edited how the hover selection process works. Then I added social media buttons
(the code to which either needs to be updated or has recent incompatability issues with tumblr). I imported, then
ediited some jQuery into the site in order to clean it up aesthetically. The final product is Field Trip Moxy,
a blog designed to showcase the youth culture of Downtown Milwaukee, and can be seen here http://fieldtripmoxy.tumblr.com/
